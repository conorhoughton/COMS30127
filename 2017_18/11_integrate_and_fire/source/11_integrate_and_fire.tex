\section*{Integrate and fire}
These notes are about a simple but very useful model of spiking
neurons: the integrate and fire model. First, though, we consider the
dynamics of a leaky bucket of water, in turns out these dynamics are
very similar to those seen in the integrate and fire model.

\subsection*{Buckets of water}

In the simplest model of neurons their voltage dynamics is similar to
the dynamics of a bucket with a leak and the class of equations that
apply in this case will also be applied to synapses, for example.

\end{picture}
\end{center}

Consider a bucket with straight sides which is filled to a height $h$
with water. Imagine the water leaks out of a hole in the bottom. The
rate the water leaks out depends on $h$; the larger $h$ is the larger
the pressure at the bottom is and hence the faster the water pours
out. In other words
\begin{equation}
l(t)\propto h(t)
\end{equation}
or 
\begin{equation}
l(t)= G h(t)
\end{equation}
where $G$ is a constant which will depend on the size of the hole and
complicated things like the viscosity of water. Of course, we are also
ignoring lots of complicated stuff, like turbulence and so forth, but
since we are interested in the equation rather than the amount of
water in a bucket, this is fine. Imagine water also pours in the top
at a rate $i(t)$. This means the total rate of change of the amount of
water is $i(t)-Gh(t)$.

Now, $h(t)$ is the height of the water not the volume: the volume is
$Ch(t)$ where $C$ is the cross-sectional area of the bucket. The rate
of change of the volume is therefore
\begin{equation}
\frac{dCh(t)}{dt}=i(t)-Gh(t)
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{1}{C}(i-Gh)
\end{equation}

This is an equation we know how to solve; we saw it at the start of
the course when learning about differential equations. This same
equation will appear when we look at the dynamics of neuron and for
similar reasons, something, water inthe case of the bucket, charge in
the case of a neuron, is being added to a leaky container.

\subsection*{Electrical properties of a neuron}
The potential inside a neuron is lower than the potential on the
outside; this difference is created by ion pumps, small molecular
machines that use energy to pump ions across the membrane seperating
the inside and outside of the cell. One typical ion pump is
Na+/K+-ATPase (Sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase); this uses
energy in the form of ATP, the energy carrying molecule in the body,
and through each cycle it moves three sodium ions out of the cell and
two potassium ions into the cell. Since both sodium and potassium ions
have a charge of plus one, this leads to a net loss of one atomic
charge to the inside of the cell lowering its potential. It also
creates an excess of sodium outside the cell and an excess of
potassium inside it. We will return to these chemical imbalances
later. The potential difference across the membrane is called the
\textbf{membrane potential}. At rest a typical value of the membrane
potential is $E_L=-70 $mV. It is useful to remember that the excessive
sodium is outside the cell and potassium inside; I think of islands
which are surrounded by salty water, as in Fig.~\ref{in_out}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{in_out}
\end{center}
\caption{A cartoon to help you remember that there is more sodium outside the cell and more potassium inside.\label{in_out}}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Spikes}

So the summary version of what happens in neuons is that
\textbf{synapses} cause a small increase or decrease in the voltage;
\textbf{excitatory synapses} cause an increase, \textbf{inhibitory
  synapses} a decrease. This drives the internal voltage dynamics of
the cell, these dynamics are what we will learn about here. If the
voltage exceeds a threshold, say $V_T=-55$ mV there is a nonlinear
cascade which produces a \textbf{spike} or \textbf{action potential},
a spike in voltage 1-2 ms wide which rises above 0 mV before, in the
usual description, falling to a reset value of $V_R=-65$ mV, the cell
then remains unable to produce another spike for a \textbf{refractory
  period} which may last about 5 ms. We will examine how spikes are
formed later, this involves the nonlinear dynamics of ion channels in
the membrane; first though we will consider the integrate and fire
model which ignores the details of how spikes are produced and
simplifies the voltage dynamics.

\subsection*{The bucket-like equation for neurons}

We will now try to extend the bucket-like equation we looked at before
so that it applies to neurons. First off we replace $h$, the height of
the water, by $V$ the voltage in the cell and $C$ will be replaced by
$C_m$, the capacitance of the membrane, the amount of electrical
charge that can be stored at the membrane is $C_mV$. The amount of
electrical charge is the analogue of the volume of water. Thus,
voltage is like height, charge is like the amount of water.

The leak is a bit more complicated, because of the chemical gradients,
that is the effects of the differing levels of ions inside and outside
the cell along and their propensity to diffuse, the voltage at which
there is no leaking of charge is not zero, it is $E_L=-70 $mV,
roughly. This is an important aspect of how neurons behave, and one we
will encounter again looking at the Hodgkin-Huxley equation: you might
at first expect that if the voltage inside the cell was, say, -60 mV
then even if there was a high conductivity for potassium at the
membrane, the potassium ions would stay in the cell: they are positive
ions after all and so a negative voltage means the electrical force is
attracting them to the inside of the cell. However, this isn't quite
what happens, there is a high concentration of potassium inside the
cell and because of the random motion of particles associated with
temperature, these have a tendency to diffuse, that is to increase the
entropy of the situation by spreading out. It takes a force to
counteract this. This is the reversal potential, $E_L$, the voltage
required for zero current even if there is some conductivity. It turns
out that the normal Ohm's law applies around the reversal potential so
that the current out of the cell is proportional to $V-E_L$.

$G$ is now $G_m$, a conductance, measuring the porousness of the
membrane to the flow of ions, in other words, it gives the constant of proportionality for the leak current: the leak current out of the cell is
$G_m(V-E_L)$. We actually divide across by the conductance, and write
$R_m=1/G_m$, the resistance. Finally, we write $\tau_m=C_m/G_m$ to get
\begin{equation}
\tau_m\frac{dV}{dt}=E_L-V+R_mI
\end{equation}
$I$ might end up being synaptic input, but traditionally we write the
equation to match the \textsl{in vivo} experiment where $I$ is an
injected current from an electrode, so we write $I_e$, \lq{}e\rq{} for
electrode. $\tau_m$ is a time constant, using the notation of
dimensional analysis we have $[\tau_m]=T$. To check this note that the
units of capacitance are charge per voltage: $[C_m]=QV^{-1}$, the
units of resistance is voltage per current $[R_m]=VI^{-1}$ and current
is charge per time, $[I]=QT^{-1}$ so $[C_mR_m]=T$, time.

The equation above leaves out the possibility that there are other
non-linear changes in the currents through the membrane as $V$
changes. This is a problem since there are other non-linear changes in
the currents through the membrane as $V$ changes. The equation above
leaves these out, in fact, the nonlinear effects are strongest for
values of $V$ near where a spike is produced, so one approach is to
use the linear equation unless $V$ reaches a threshold value and then
add a spike \lq{}by hand\rq{}. This has the effect of changing the
voltage to a reset value, this mimics what happens in the neuron, or
in the Hodgkin Huxley model which we will look at next and which
includes the full non-linear dynamics which makes the spike. Anyway,
in summary
\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\tau_m\frac{dV}{dt}=E_L-V+R_mI_e
\end{equation}
\item If $V\ge V_T$ a spike is recorded and the voltage is set to a
  reset value $V_R$.
\end{itemize}
The reset value, the voltage after the spike is often set equal to the
 leak potential. This is the \textbf{leaky integrate and fire model}, a surprisingly
old model first introduced in \cite{Lapicque1907a}. It lacks lots of
the details important in the dynamics of neurons, but is useful and
often used for modeling the behavior of large neuronal networks or for
exploring ideas about neuronal computation in a relatively
straight-forward setting.

This model is easy to solve; if $I_e$ is constant we have already
solved it above, up to messing around with constants:
\begin{equation}
V(t)=E_L+R_mI_e+[V(0)-E_L-R_mI_e]e^{-t/\tau_m}
\end{equation}
If $I_e$ is not
constant it may still be possible to solve the equation, but in any
case the equation can be solved numerically on a computer. An example
in given in Fig.~\ref{v_i_f}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\include{v_i_f}
\end{center}
\caption{An integrate and fire neuron with different inputs. For
  $R_mI=12 $mV the voltage relaxes towards the equilibrium value
  $V=E_L+R_mI_e=-58$ mV. It never reaches the threshold value of
  $V_T=-55 $mV. For $R_mI=16$ mV the voltage reaches threshold and so
  there is a spike; the spike is added by hand, in this case by
  setting $V$ to $20$ mV for one time step. The voltage is then
  reset. Here $\tau_m=10$ ms.\label{v_i_f}}
\end{figure}

One thing to notice is that there are no spikes for low values of the current. Looking at the equation 
\begin{equation}
\tau_m\frac{dV}{dt}=E_L-V+R_mI_e
\end{equation}
so the equilibrium value for constant $I_e$, the value where $V$ stops changing, is
\begin{equation}
\bar{V}=E_L+R_mI_e
\end{equation}
Now if this value $\bar{V}>V_T$ then as the neuron voltage increased
towards its equilibrium value, $\bar{V}$, it would reach the
threshold, $V_T$, and spike. Hence, if $\bar{V}>V_T$ the neuron will
spike repeatedly.  However if $\bar{V}<V_T$ then the neuron will not
spike for that input because it will never reach threshold. 

In fact, we can work out the curve that represents the firing rate as
a function of the current; this is the called the f-I curve and is shown in Fig.~\ref{f_i_curve}. In the model
\begin{equation}
\tau_m\frac{dV}{dt}=E_L-V+R_mI_e
\end{equation}
which we can solve from our study of odes, it gives
\begin{equation}
V(t)=E_L+R_mI_e+[V(0)-E_L-R_mI_e]e^{-t/\tau_m}
\end{equation}
so if the neuron has spiked and is reset at time $t=0$ and reaches
threshold at time $t=T$, assume $V_R=E_L$ we have
\begin{equation}
V_T=E_L+R_mI_e-R_mI_ee^{-T/\tau_m}
\end{equation}
so 
\begin{equation}
e^{-T/\tau_m}=\frac{E_L+R_mI_e-V_T}{R_mI_e}
\end{equation}
Taking the log of both sides we get
\begin{equation}
T=\tau_m\log\left[\frac{R_mI_e}{E_L+R_mI_e-V_T}\right]
\end{equation}
Finally, this is the time between spikes, so the frequency is one over this. It is only defined for $R_mI_e>V_T-E_L$, below that there is no spiking and the frequency is zero. The actual gnuplot command used to make the figure was\\
\texttt{plot [0:22] x>15 ? 1/(.01*log(x/(x-15))) : 0}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\include{f_i_curve}
\end{center}
\caption{The firing rate, that is spikes per second, for the integrate
  and fire neuron with different constant inputs with $\tau_m=10$ ms,
  $V_T=-55$ mV and both the leak and reset given by $-70$ mV. Notice
  how there is no firing until a threshold is reached and after that
  the firing increases very quickly. \label{f_i_curve}}
\end{figure}

In fact, neurons tend not to have a regular firing rate; they often,
for example, show spike rate adaptation. This means that the firing
rate decreases even if the incoming current remains constant. As we
have seen this isn't modelling in the integrate and fire model, in the
integrate and fire model the response to a constant current is a
constant firing rate. The model can be extended to include it. For
example a slow potassium current could be added, a slow potassium
current is a current that would increase every time there is a spike
and decrease between spikes. Since a potassium current reduces the
voltage inside the cell, it decreases the firing rate; thus, if the
cell fires quickly the potassium current increases, decreasing the
firing rate until the increase in the potassium when there is a spike
balances the decrease between spikes.
